# self-tuning-sort-algorithm
The Self-Tuning Sort algorithm is a novel sorting technique that aims to improve the efficiency of sorting operations. It involves analyzing the input data and splitting the array into subarrays based on their characteristics, such as increasing, decreasing, or random sequences. The algorithm then applies the Merge Sort's merge subarrays' approach to sort the array.

***Key Features:***

* **Input Analysis:** The algorithm performs a preliminary analysis of the input data to identify the characteristics of the array, such as increasing, decreasing, or random sequences.
* **Subarray Splitting:** Based on the analysis, the array is split into subarrays, grouping together elements with similar characteristics.
* **Merge Sort Approach:** The algorithm employs the merge functionality from the Merge Sort algorithm to merge and sort the subarrays, ensuring the final sorted array.

***Benefits:***

* **Improved Efficiency:**
By leveraging the characteristics of the input data, the Self-Tuning Sort algorithm optimizes the sorting process, resulting in improved efficiency.
* **Adaptive Sorting:**
The algorithm dynamically adapts its sorting approach based on the characteristics of the array, allowing it to handle various types of data more effectively.
* **Scalability:**
The algorithm demonstrates good performance even with large arrays, making it suitable for sorting operations of various sizes.
